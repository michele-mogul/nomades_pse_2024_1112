This is a hashed password that is generated using the SHA-256 algorithm.
You task is to find the password that was used to generate this hash.
For that you need to know some information about the password:
- It is an alphabetical string
- It is a lower case string
- It is a 5 letter string

The password to be found is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.
The SHA-256 algorithm is a hashing algorithm that takes a string as input and generates a 256 bit (32 byte) hash as output.
The hash is a hexadecimal string that is 64 characters long.

*You can use the hashlib library to generate the hash of a string.*

example:

```python    
password = hashlib.sha256("MyCurrentPassword".encode()).hexdigest()
```

here, `MyCurrentPassword` is the password string you want to find the hash for.

the `hexdigest()` method returns the hash as a hexadecimal **string**.

Knowing that information, 
you can write a program that will generate all possible combinations of 5 letter strings. and try to break the password.
